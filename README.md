     ->Sibling moving concept?
     ->Traverse back to parent from child?
     ->How to identify an element with Text based  directly?
     
   Important points to remember:
   -->With xpath we can traverse back to parent from child but in css we can't traverse back to parent from child
   -->Css is very fast than xpath
   -->Relative path is more preferred tha the absolute path
