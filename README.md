?????-------------------------Day0_learning------------------?????
Learn Basics of selenium which are very essential:
    ->WebDriver
    ->setproperty(Key,value)
    ->Locators
          ->id
          ->name
          ->className
          ->linktext
          ->Xpath [//tagname[@Attribute='value']]
          ->Css [tagname[Attribute='value]
     ->actions(get("url"),click(),sendKey("values"))
     ->parent-child way for finding xpath
     ->Difference between absolute path & relative path?
     ->Sibling moving concept?
     ->Traverse back to parent from child?
     ->How to identify an element with Text based  directly?
     
   Important points to remember:
   -->With xpath we can traverse back to parent from child but in css we can't traverse back to parent from child
   -->Css is very fast than xpath
   -->Relative path is more preferred tha the absolute path
